# dogelistener

Listen and track your doge.

## Run

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Resolve missing pip packages manually, requirements.txt is not up to date.

Had to clone PortAudio and build from source since it was failing to install.

I had to clone pyAudioAnalysis locally and install those pip requirements.
